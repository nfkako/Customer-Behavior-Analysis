Hello and welcome!

1. Are you a retail business seeking a broader understanding of your customers' behaviours?
2. Are you interested in increasing your sales and customer satisfaction?

If yes, then look no further.

This project aims to answer the above critical business questions using Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) analysis and Machine Learning techniques such as K-means clustering for customer segmentation, and by applying Market Basket Analysis (MBA) technique in order to find the items that customers purchase together. This helps the retail business store or website design their layout in a manner that meets customer satisfaction and boosts sales at the same time.
